How to use:
./wrapper /path/to/exec judge_ip_address contest_id username password


For example running test_exec.sh program connected to 127.1 (localhost) to
contest of id 1 with username a and password a, would be:
./wrapper ./test_exec.sh 127.1 1 a a

Wrapper ends execution when it discovers that the programs output pipe is
broken (because it could not change the game state anymore anyways, so why
bother?), this means that the program will execute infinitelly if it does not
end or is not interupted.

Putting data manually to the wrapper.

STILL NOT WORKING, but is supposed to work be used like this:
./create_fifo
./wrapper ./manual_input address contest_id username password
./input_for_manual_play 
    and now You would type input, but it seems that the fifo is not flushed
    properely or something
