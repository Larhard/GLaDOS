How to use:
./wrapper /path/to/exec judge_ip_address contest_id username password


For example running test_exec.sh program connected to 127.1 (localhost) to
contest of id 1 with username a and password a, would be:
./wrapper ./test_exec.sh 127.1 1 a a

Wrapper ends execution when it discovers that the programs output pipe is
broken (because it could not change the game state anymore anyways, so why
bother?), this means that the program will execute infinitelly if it does not
end or is not interupted.

Putting data manually to the wrapper:

Working sometimes, but better that than nothing.

./create_fifo (ommitable if my_input already present)

in parallel:
    ./wrapper ./manual_input adress contest_id username password
    ./input_for_manual_play # <- type input here
